        </p>
        <h3><li>FEES AND EXPENSES</li></h3>
        <p>
          We will do our best at the outset to give you an estimate of the likely overall cost in relation to a matter.  There are, of course, many variables which come into play and therefore we will provide you with an estimate based upon the information we have at any particular stage.  Unless our Engagement Letter states otherwise, any estimate or quotation of costs we give you is only a guide to assist you in budgeting and should not be regarded as a website or a fixed or capped fee.  We shall do our best to notify you if any estimate of our time and/or fees that we have given you needs to be changed as a result of a change in circumstances.
        </p>
        <p>
          If we are instructed by joint clients then all clients are jointly and severally liable for our fees, notwithstanding any agreement between you as to how you will share the costs.  This means that we will be able to look to one client only or to each of our clients to pay the whole of or any balance of any unpaid fees.
        </p>
        <p>
          Our charges are primarily  based upon the time we spend dealing with your matter including meetings with you and others; any time spent in travelling (for example, to and from Court or to meetings); and in such circumstances to be called as witness in that case the user or its representative have to bare and pay all the traveling, accommodation, food and other ancillary expenses considering, preparing and working on papers; correspondence (whether written or electronic); and making and receiving telephone calls.  The hourly charging rate which will apply will be confirmed in the Engagement Letter.  If there is to be a change in the hourly rates applicable to your matter, you will be notified in writing and you will then be bound by them.  If you do not accept the new rates after review, we reserve the right not to continue acting for you.
        </p>
        <p>
          These rates take into account a number of factors which include the complexity of the issue, the speed at which action was to be taken; the expertise or specialist knowledge which the case requires and, if appropriate, the value of the property or subject matter involved.  Accordingly, the rate may be increased if, for example, the matter becomes more complex than expected. If the scope of the work changes or our assumptions change, we will discuss a revised fee arrangement or estimate with you.
        </p>
        <h3><li>BILLING ARRANGEMENTS</li></h3>
        <p>
          We will send you a final bill after completion of the matter after your written email to us.  However, it is likely that we will also render interim bills to you at regular intervals until the matter is concluded.  If a payment on account has been made by you, this will be utilized towards satisfying interim bills. Any balances held will remain as general money on account of fees and disbursements to be incurred we may also request you to make further payments on account from time to time. Even if someone else has agreed to pay or be responsible for payment of all or part of your legal costs, we will normally address our bills to you and you will, in any event, be primarily liable to us for those costs.  Our bills are due for payment on delivery and we will be entitled to claim interest at the rate of 12% above the base rate of bank name if any of them are not discharged within 30 days after the date the bill is sent to you. We may pay any outstanding invoice by deduction from money we hold for you (including money received from others).  If you have any queries about a bill please contact the person who sent it as soon as you receive it.  Please note that you may have a right to object to the bill by making a complaint.

        <h3><li>MONEY LAUNDERING PRECAUTIONS</li></h3>
        <p>

        </p>
      <ul>
        <li>
          <strong>Identification checks:-</strong>
          <p>
            We may need to obtain formal evidence of your identity.  This may be necessary even though we have acted for you before, or even if you are known personally to a member of staff.  We will tell you if such evidence is necessary, but it may help us if you are able to bring evidence to our first meeting.  Normally, the evidence we request is your passport, plus two or more documents to establish your address, such as recent utility bills, council tax statements, or bank statements not being more than three months old as proof of address. In certain circumstances we may carry out searches to verify your identity and proof of address.
          </p>
        </li>
        <li><strong>Cash:–</strong>
          <p>
            We are normally only able to accept cash up to a limit prescribed by law of  in any 28 day period.  If you circumvent this policy by depositing cash direct with our bank we reserve the right to charge for any additional checks we deem necessary regarding the source of funds. This can be costly and will almost certainly delay your transaction.

          <p>
            at the start of any matter we will normally ask you to tell us the source of any funds you will be using.  It is simplest if the source is an account, in your name, or building society.  If the source is an unusual one, such as an account in another country, or in the name of someone other than yourself, please tell us as early as possible, including the reason.  Failure to disclose the details of the source of funds may lead us to terminate your retainer.
