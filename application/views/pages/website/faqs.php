          <h4>What is the difference between a living will and a last will?  </h4>
          <p>
            A living will, despite its name, isn't at all like the wills that people use to leave property at their death. The basic difference is that a last will is used to dispose of assets after death. A living will can be used to provide health care instructions in advance, such as whether or not life support is desired. A living will, also called a directive to physicians or advance directive, is a document that lets people state their wishes for end-of-life medical care, in case they become unable to communicate their decisions. It has no power after death.

          <h4>Can I disinherit my spouse? </h4>
          <p>
            In states where common law governs inheritance laws, a person may choose to disinherit a spouse through a will. That property must be willed to someone else. If there is no other person inheriting that property then it will go the heir as per the succession law even though you have stated that it must not go to that heir. In community property states, a spouse is legally entitled to the property acquired or earned during the marriage. While a married person may leave their certain share to the community property to someone other than their spouse, they may not dispose of the spouse's share of the community property.

If there is no alternate beneficiary to inherit your estate upon your death, your Will would then be subject to your state’s “Anti-Lapse” Laws so it is advised to revise your will if beneficiary dies.
          </p>
          <div class="line"></div>
          <h4> How long is my Will valid ?</h4>
          <p>
            In general a Will is valid unless it is challenged in court and declared null and void by court of law, but there are a few exceptions. In certain religions if you were married at the time you made a Will and then later got a divorce, in most states either your entire Will was revoked or the portions of your Will that gave property to your former spouse were revoked by the divorce. The remaining portions of your Will might also be affected if the property listed in your Will went to your spouse in the divorce settlement or decree. If you intentionally destroyed the original of your Will or wrote a new Will that revoked it that also would invalidate your Will.
          </p>
          <p>
            A Will that has been revoked by someone who is legally competent cannot be revived; you have to make a new Will. So, for example, if you have a Will, then change your mind and write a new Will saying that you revoke the original Will, if you change your mind again and destroy the second Will, that would not make the first Will valid again. You have to remake the original Will.
